# Data Source
Predict'em All from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall
PokemonGO from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemongo
Google Map API for geocoding
Weather API

# Platform

1. Experiment on Zeppelin

2. Transplant to IDE

# Next Step

1. Data Cleansing
     
     (1) Drop these columns: pokemonId, appearedLocalTime, X_id, cellId_90m, cellId_180m, cellId_370m, cellId_730m, cellId_1460m, cellId_2920m, cellId_5850m, appearedDayOfWeek, appearedMonth, appearedYear, weatherIcon
     
     (2) Replace all "TURE" and "FALSE" with "1" and "0"
     
     (3) Represent appearedTimeOfDay, city, continent and weather as their corresponding number (start from 1)
     
     (4) Merge data from PokemonGO, add rarity and type data
     
     (5) Abstract US data
     
     (6) Normalization
     
2. Logistic Regression

     (1) With 151 poke monster, the highest accuracy we got is 22%
     
     (2) With 3 rarities(common, rare and very rare), accuracy is 91%
     
     (3) With 15 types, accuracy is 48%
     
3. Dimension reduction
     
     PCA
